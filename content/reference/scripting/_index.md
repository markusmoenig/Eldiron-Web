Scripting is an important building block for many tasks in Eldiron.

It provides the foundation of the node system and with screen scripts you define both the visible content of your game as well as the user interaction.

The scripting engine in Eldiron uses [Rhai](https://rhai.rs), a Rust based, easy-to-use yet powerful scripting language. Please see the [Rhai Book](https://rhai.rs/book/) for furher information on Rhai and it's syntax.
