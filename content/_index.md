![Eldiron Map](./coverlarge.png)

Eldiron is a cross-platform creator for classic, retro role-playing-games (RPGs). It’s main aim is to create games similar to the RPGs of the 80’s and 90’s but with modern features as well as support for single and multi-player experiences, procedural content and much more.

Eldiron supports 2D games (like Ultima 4/5), isometric games and first-person games out of the box.

Eldiron is open source and licensed under the MIT.

**Eldiron is currently undergoing a pre-v1 rewrite. A new version with a Doom style editor system will be released soon (February / March 2025).**
