![Eldiron Map](./coverlarge.png)

Eldiron is a cross-platform creator for classic, retro role-playing-games (RPGs). It’s main aim is to create games similar to the RPGs of the 80’s and 90’s but with modern features as well as support for single and multi-player experiences, procedural content and much more.

Eldiron supports 2D games (like Ultima 4/5), Isometric and First-Person games out of the box.

Eldiron is open source and licensed under the MIT.

**The first alpha version of Eldiron with the new Doom style editor is now available. I am currently working on documentation and tutorial videos, watch this space!**
