## üõ†Ô∏è Client-Side Scripting & UI

Until now, Eldiron has focused on **server-side scripting** for all game behavior, entities, and world logic. With the upcoming release, attention shifts to the **client side**, enabling the creation of fully interactive UI screens ‚Äî all directly within the map editor.

### What's Next

- üß© **Sectors as UI Widgets**
  Create interactive UI screens using sectors in your map. Buttons, panels, menus ‚Äî all designed visually using the same tools as maps.

- ‚ö° **Client-Side Scripting**
  Define what happens when a player clicks a button, interacts with a widget, or opens a UI screen. These scripts run instantly on the client for a smooth, responsive experience.

- üîÅ **Complete Server/Client Architecture**
  UI logic runs on the client, while core game behavior stays securely on the server. This finalizes the split between client and server responsibilities ‚Äî making the system fast, flexible, and future-proof.

This update lays the foundation for powerful UI creation in Eldiron and completes the core architecture of the engine. The new release is just a few weeks away!

Stay tuned, and thanks for following along!
