## Features of v1

* Support games similar to Ultima 4 / 5 or any game which uses a rectangular grid layout.
* Eldiron has an easy to use, grid based, visual scripting language for creating the game logic with visual feedback and debugging.
* Either render 2D tiles directly or in 3D. Games can switch between the two modes at runtime or display both at the same time (for example use the tiles view as a mini-map).
* Eldiron comes with integrated tile-maps or your can use your own square tiles with up to four levels of transparency.
* Single-player or multi-player experiences. Eldiron has a sophisticated multi-threaded server architecture to allow for as many player or NPC characters as possible.
* Cross platform. Eldiron is written in Rust and can nearly run everywhere, i.e. on the Web, macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android etc. Eldiron Creator can run on any desktop.
