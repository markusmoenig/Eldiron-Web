[Eldiron](https://eldiron.com) is a cross-platform creator for classic role-playing-games (RPGs). It's main aim is to create games similar to the RPGs of the 80's and 90's but with modern features as well as support for single and multi-player experiences.

Eldiron consists of [Eldiron Creator](../creator/), a desktop application available for macOS, Windows and Linux, and various clients (and a server) which will run the created games on nearly any device.

Eldiron v1.0 is under active development and scheduled for the first half of 2024. V1 will be able to create games similar to Ultima 4 and 5 (or any game using square tiles) including 3D retro regions and multi-player servers.

Later goals are support for more perspectives (like isometric) and much more.

Eldiron is open source (licensed under the MIT) and 100% free to use.

### Documentation

This documentation provides the core information about Eldiron, the basic mechanics, how to ship or host games and the scripting and node reference.

This is supplementary to the tutorials I will provide on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCmrO356zLQv_m8dPEqBUfA) which will cover all these topics and more in detail.

Screenshots and user interfaces change, and for me it is easier to create a new video explaining these changes than trying to keep the documentation up-to-date.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out via the [Eldiron Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ZrNj6baSZU).
