## Opening a Door

Opening a door can be achieved in different ways depending on your **gameplay mechanics**. For example, you could open a door when:
- A character **bumps into it**.
- The player **clicks a "Use" or "Open" button**.

Let's start with the **simplest approach**: opening a door when a character **bumps into it**.

### **Example: Auto-Opening Door**

```python
# Taken from https://github.com/markusmoenig/Eldiron/blob/master/examples/Harbor.eldiron

class Door:

    def event(self, event, value):

        if event == "bumped_by_entity":
            set_attr("visible", False)
            set_attr("blocking", False)
            notify_in(2, "close_door")

        if event == "close_door":
            if len(entities_in_radius()) == 0:
                set_attr("visible", True)
                set_attr("blocking", True)
            else:
                notify_in(2, "close_door")
```

### **How It Works**
1. When a character **bumps into the door**, the `bumped_by_entity` event is triggered.
2. The door **opens** by setting:
   - `visible = False` (door disappears).
   - `blocking = False` (door no longer blocks movement).
3. The `notify_in(2, "close_door")` function **delays closing** the door for **2 seconds**.
4. When `close_door` is triggered, the script:
   - **Checks if the area is empty** (`entities_in_radius() == 0`).
   - If **empty**, the door **closes** (`visible = True`, `blocking = True`).
   - If **not empty**, it **delays the closing** again by 2 seconds.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting the `blocking` attribute isnâ€™t strictly necessary in this case, since the door **instantly opens** on contact. However, it is included here for **clarity and flexibility** in different scenarios.

## Opening a Locked Gate

Opening a **locked gate** works similarly to opening a **door**, but with one key difference:
- The gate **requires a key** to open.
- On the `bumped_by_entity` event, the script checks if the **character has the correct key** in their inventory.

```python
# Taken from https://github.com/markusmoenig/Eldiron/blob/master/examples/Harbor.eldiron

class Gate:

    def event(self, event, value):
        if event == "bumped_by_entity":
            if len(inventory_items_of(value, "Golden Key")) > 0:
                set_attr("visible", False)
                set_attr("blocking", False)
                notify_in(2, "close_gate")
        if event == "close_gate":
            if len(entities_in_radius()) == 0:
                set_attr("visible", True)
                set_attr("blocking", True)
            else:
                notify_in(2, "close_gate")
```

### **How It Works**
1. When a character **bumps into the gate**, the `bumped_by_entity` event is triggered.
2. The `value` parameter contains the **ID of the character** that bumped into the gate.
3. The script checks if that character **has a "Golden Key"** in their inventory using:
   - `inventory_items_of(value, "Golden Key") > 0`
4. If the character **has the key**, the gate **opens** by setting:
   - `visible = False` (gate disappears).
   - `blocking = False` (gate no longer blocks movement).
5. The `notify_in(2, "close_gate")` function **delays closing** the gate for **2 seconds**.
6. When `close_gate` is triggered, the script:
   - **Checks if the area is empty** (`entities_in_radius() == 0`).
   - If **empty**, the gate **closes** (`visible = True`, `blocking = True`).
   - If **not empty**, it **delays closing** again by **2 seconds**.

> [!TIP]
> - The `value` parameter in `bumped_by_entity` holds the **ID of the character** who collided with the gate.
> - We pass this ID to `inventory_items_of(value, "Golden Key")` to **check that specific character's inventory**.
> - This script can be adapted to check for **different key types** by replacing `"Golden Key"` with another item name.
