The **Rect Tool** (keyboard shortcut **'R'**) allows you to **directly draw tiles** onto the map.

Unlike other map-based tools, the **Rect Tool does not edit geometry**â€”instead, it **instantly places selected tiles, materials, or colors** into the map grid.

### How It Works

- The **Rect Tool automatically creates the geometry** for a **sector** and **assigns the selected tile**.
- Click on the map to **draw**.
- **Shift + Click** to **delete content**.

### Modes

The Rect Tool has **two modes**:

- **Overwrite Mode**: Replaces any existing tiles in the grid.
- **Layer Mode**: Places tiles **on top** of existing ones, allowing layered decorations.

## When to Use the Rect Tool

- **2D Games**: The **Rect Tool is the primary tool** for quickly drawing large tile areas.
- **3D Games**: Used for adding details like **carpets, signs, or decorations**. Tile settings determine how the tile is rendered:
  - As a **billboard**
  - As a **box**
  - As **floor decoration**
- **Materials**: Functions as a **drawing tool**, allowing you to place **individual pixels**.

The **Rect Tool** is a fast and intuitive way to add **tiles, decorations, and details** to your maps and materials.
